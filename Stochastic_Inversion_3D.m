function varargout = Stochastic_Inversion_3D(varargin)
% STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D MATLAB code for Stochastic_Inversion_3D.fig
%      STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D, by itself, creates a new STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D or raises the existing
%      singleton*.
%
%      H = STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D returns the handle to a new STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D or the handle to
%      the existing singleton*.
%
%      STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D('CALLBACK',hObject,eventData,handles,...) calls the local
%      function named CALLBACK in STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D.M with the given input arguments.
%
%      STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D('Property','Value',...) creates a new STOCHASTIC_INVERSION_3D or raises the
%      existing singleton*.  Starting from the left, property value pairs are
%      applied to the GUI before Stochastic_Inversion_3D_OpeningFcn gets called.  An
%      unrecognized property name or invalid value makes property application
%      stop.  All inputs are passed to Stochastic_Inversion_3D_OpeningFcn via varargin.
%
%      *See GUI Options on GUIDE's Tools menu.  Choose "GUI allows only one
%      instance to run (singleton)".
